This is a React-on-Node boilerplate with Redux architecture. The skeleton for this boilerplate was done with the aid of [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-2f8cbbeb9b3f) with modifications to fit the new configurations that have popped up since its publication.

I also borrowed heavily from a previous boilerplate I had written using [a React-on-Rails approach](https://github.com/eliza-jane/react-on-rails-boilerplate).

To add Redux, I followed guidelines set up by this coder. (add link when done)

Test are done in Jest and Enzyme. To run the tests, you can run the following:

`npm run test`

To run this boilerplate, you can clone the repo to your machine, then run the following:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Feature list:
- [ ] (1) Basic server with stateless React Component
- [ ] (2) Add Stateful Component
- [ ] (3) Add testing for both components (update Karma/Enzyme tests in React-on-Rails repo for Jest)
- [ ] (4) Add support for bundling for production
- [ ] (5) Add Redux
- [ ] (6) Redux testing??
